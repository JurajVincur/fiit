# Design of Structure, Behavior, and Implementation

**Format:** EA project file (diagrams) + zip (source code)  
**Submission:** before the 11th exercise  

## Assignment
In this part, we focus on the **gradual transition from design to implementation**.  
Your task is to prepare several types of UML diagrams that capture the structure and behavior of the system, and then implement a selected part of the model as a functional prototype of a **GUI** application.  

- **Class diagram**  
  - at least **12 elements**,  
  - include **attributes and operations**,  
  - show **relationships between classes and interfaces**.  

- **Object diagram**  
  - illustrate an important object configuration for the project,  
  - provide at least **2 variants** of this configuration (e.g., before and after interaction).  

- **Package diagram**  
  - organize classes into packages,  
  - specify the correct relationships between packages.  

- **Sequence diagram**  
  - specify at least **2 selected methods** (from those that were implemented),  
  - non-trivial complexity with appropriate use of **combined fragments**.  

- **State diagram**  
  - at least **2 correct state diagrams**,  
  - correct use of pseudostates and transitions,  
  - in at least one diagram there must be another pseudostate besides *initial* (*terminate* alone is not sufficient).  

- **Component diagram**  
  - represent the system architecture,  
  - correctly specify interfaces and dependencies (*assembly*, *dependency*),  
  - provide an adequate **description of elements**.  

- **Implementation**  
  - provide the corresponding **code** for the selected part of the model in a programming language of your choice,  
  - implement at least **3 user-goal use cases** (a simple GUI application),  
  - identify and describe the **relationship of the code to the architecture and use cases** (commentary),  
  - the implemented prototype must be functional and demonstrated during the final presentation.  

## Evaluation (max. 37 points)

  - Class diagram – **6 points**  
  - Object diagram – **2 points**  
  - Package diagram – **2 points**  
  - Sequence diagram – **6 points**  
  - State diagram – **4 points**  
- Components – **6 points**  
- Code – **11 points**
