# Use Cases and Initial Behavioral Model

**Format:** PDF (use case descriptions) + EA project file (diagrams)  
**Submission:** before the 7th exercise  

## Assignment
- Describe at least **6 user-goal use cases** with non-trivial flows.  
- The description of use cases must follow **Cockburn’s** or **Jacobson’s notation** (the instructor decides which).  
- Use cases of type **CRUD** for a single entity count as **one** use case.  
- The description of use cases must include:  
  - **alternative flow**,  
  - **include relationship**,  
  - **extend relationship**,  
  - **generalization**.  
- Create a **use case diagram**.  
- For at least **3 use cases** (their flows) prepare:  
  - **sequence diagrams**,  
  - **activity diagrams**.  
- For the same use cases, identify collaborations and create **composite structure diagrams** for them.  

## Evaluation (max. 23 points)
- Use case descriptions – **9 points**  
- Relationships between use cases – **6 points**  
- Activity, sequence, and composite structure diagrams – **8 points**
