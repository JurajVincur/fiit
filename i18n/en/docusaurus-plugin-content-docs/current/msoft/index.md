## Project
The goal of the semester project is to practice the basic principles of software design according to standard methodologies.  
During the semester, students will gradually complete different parts of the project and present them during the exercises.

### Main Parts
1. Project intent (**5 pts**, textual description)  
2. Use cases (**15 pts**, use case descriptions, use case diagram)  
3. Initial behavioral model in UML (**8 pts**, sequence, activity, and composite structure diagrams)  
4. Components (**6 pts**, component diagram)  
5. Objects, classes, and interaction (**20 pts**, class, object, package, sequence, and state diagrams)  
6. Code (**11 pts**, GUI application prototype, any programming language)  

> The quality of work on the project (assessed during exercises) is worth an additional **5 points**.<br/>
> All models must be created in **EA (version 17)**.

### Submissions
- **1st submission** Before the 3rd exercise, [Part 1](/docs/msoft/project/part1) (PDF)  
- **2nd submission** Before the 7th exercise, [Parts 2–3](/docs/msoft/project/part23) (PDF + EA)  
- **3rd submission** Before the 11th exercise, [Parts 4–6](/docs/msoft/project/part46) (EA + zip)  

> All models must be submitted as a **single EA project**.<br/>
> Text documents must be submitted in **PDF**.<br/>
> Implementation must be submitted in a single **zip** archive.<br/>
